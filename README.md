# Explorative data analysis of loan data in the US, 2005-2014
October 2017, Christopher Buss

## Overview
In this project, I explored load data from *Prosper*, a US-based lending platform. The data set contains data from 113,937 loans and 84 variables. The objectives of the analysis was to summarize the data to determine (1) the relationship between the various variables of interest and (2) how the interest rates for individuals loans can be predicted with the available data.I used a wide range of plots to explore the data and find relationships.
